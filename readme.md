# Controlpanel Docs
The official controlpanel docs. in the root directory, Iâ€™ve included a simple node.js web server for easy deployment. for local development, you can just hop into the 'docs' folder and run the local dev server.

## Local development
### Install node_modules for docs
```bash
cd docs/
npm install
```

### Run development server
```bash
npm run start
```

## Deploy webserver
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
