# Translating
You can speak your mother tongue?
You understand a certain language very well?
Then we need exactly **you for our translator team!**

After a long wait, the controlpanel has now been equipped with a translation system.

*Now we need people who help us translate!*

## How to help

The Translation list can be found here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1day2die/dashboard/localization/resources/lang/de.json

Its simple to understand. The syntax goes like this
`'English-Phrase' : 'Your-Language-Translation',`

You first need a JSON-File named after your language's Language-Code
These can be taken from here
https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

Example:
`German = de`
`Dutch = nl`
`French = fr`

Copy the Contents of the above linked "de.json" and use it as a template for your language and just translate!
Its very easy and everyone can help us translate our panel!
